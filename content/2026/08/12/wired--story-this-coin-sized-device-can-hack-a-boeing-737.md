Even as the digital components of so many life-critical systems have proven susceptible to cybersabotage—cars, medical devices, even water utilities and power grids—the computer systems of airplanes have, thankfully, remained uniquely inaccessible to hackers. But one group of academic researchers has spent years testing a different, devious approach to aviation cybersecurity. Perhaps, they suggest, a plane could be hacked the same way that spies and saboteurs have targeted other high-value, offline computers: by surreptitiously gaining physical access to one and plugging in a device designed to silently run the attackers' malicious code.

Tomorrow at the Usenix Cybersecurity Conference, researchers from the University of California at San Diego and Oberlin College will present a hacking technique capable of commandeering the autopilot of a Boeing 737 to redirect its navigation or silently altering key values in the plane's takeoff and fuel calculations while spoofing the results on the pilot's screen—subtle changes the researchers say could potentially cause anything from runway overruns on takeoff to diversions to a different country's airspace to catastrophic crashes.

To carry out that hacking, they've built a roughly coin-sized, Wi-Fi-enabled prototype device that costs less than $100. In less than a minute, that hardware implant can be fitted into a port accessible via a hatch on the exterior of the plane, one that's routinely within reach of maintenance workers or other airport and airline staff between flights. Once it's in place, the device can send electrical signals on one of the 737's internal networks to spoof commands to sensitive computer systems that guide its autopilot and show the pilot variables like the plane's total weight and outside air temperature, which play a critical role in a 737's takeoff calculations.

By proving the viability of that technique, the result of a process that stretched over more than a decade and entailed buying tens of thousands of dollars’ worth of plane components for testing, they hope to show that this sort of physical access hacking represents a practical threat in the hands of well-resourced saboteurs and a significant blind spot in aircraft security. Compared to the traditional threat of simply planting a bomb on a plane, they argue, it's also an approach that would offer an attacker more control, stealth, and deniability.

“If you could get 60 seconds with an airplane, what could you do?” asks Stefan Savage, one of the UCSD computer science professors who led the project, describing the question that first motivated their line of research. “Well, it turns out there’s a port that’s externally accessible. You can get to it with no special tools in about 15 seconds. And you can shove in a piece of electronics a little bigger than a quarter that lets you basically tell the autopilot what to do and lie to the pilot about changes to the flight plan.”

The researchers aren't revealing which port they targeted on the 737, nor are they releasing some details of how their hacking device is able to spoof commands to the plane's computers. They've worked closely with Boeing to share their findings, first disclosing elements of their research to the company more than six years ago, and going so far as to test out and demonstrate their attack in a Boeing facility's test lab.

When WIRED reached out to Boeing about the researchers' work, it responded in a statement that it had carried out its own review of its components' designs, installations, and interfaces in response to the researchers' findings. But it downplayed the practical risk of their physical-access hacking technique. “Our technical experts are confident that the layers of protection in place on the airplane, including within the system design and the operating environment, provide sufficient mitigation to significantly limit the feasibility and risk of real-world attacks,” the statement reads.

For their part, the researchers say, Boeing hasn't told them about any technical fix for the vulnerabilities they've discovered—and they speculate that the company may not in fact implement any such update to their systems for years to come, given how rarely commercial airplanes are redesigned.

That lack of an immediate security update for planes shouldn't be cause for panic or grounding aircraft, they write in their paper. “All of the authors of this paper routinely travel on Boeing 737 aircraft and expect to continue doing so,” the introduction of the paper reads.

Savage argues, though, that the research has demonstrated the need for long-term changes in both the cybersecurity of airplane components and, perhaps more immediately, the operational security measures that determine who can access a plane while it's on the ground. Their simplest fix suggestion: Plug the port with epoxy, or remove it altogether.

“This is something the aviation industry will want to plan to defend against,” Savage says. “I would not sleep on this one.”

## **Building a Plane, Then Breaking It**

This particular team of researchers' interest in hacking a plane originated nearly a decade and a half ago, when some of them discovered and demonstrated the first successful over-the-internet techniques for hacking a car's computer systems, including its steering and brakes. Their proof-of-concept attack methods, particularly ones carried out by exploiting a Chevy Impala's OnStar system, launched an era of automotive hacking research that ultimately led to a sea change in carmakers' cybersecurity practices, including launching bug bounty programs for cars and hiring car hackers to help them root out vulnerabilities.

In the wake of that car-hacking work, one member of the team, then UCSD research scientist Kirill Levchenko, suggested they try hacking airplanes next. But unlike a Chevy Impala, a Boeing 737 was well beyond their budget. “I pointed out that we can’t exactly buy a plane and put it in the parking lot, but he was undeterred,” Savage says.

Over the following years, the team began buying computer components from that commercial aircraft whenever they could find them for sale, spending tens of thousands of dollars to acquire the equipment on the secondhand market. By 2019 they had assembled what they called Triton, an “avionics test bed" that essentially consisted of wired-together 737 computer parts.

Around the same time, UCSD professor Aaron Schulman was working on another research project on credit card skimmer devices that hackers were physically planting on gas station point-of-sale terminals to steal payment information. “We realized that it's a reasonable threat for someone to plug a device into a bus and read stuff off of it and potentially even gain control of it,” says Schulman, using the term “bus” to mean an internal network connecting components of a piece of digital equipment. Schulman began to wonder if a similar physical access attack might work on the internal bus of a plane. “We were like, ‘Wait a minute, we’ve got to rethink everything.’”

With that idea in mind, one of Schulman's then student researchers, Sam Crowe, hunted through hundreds of pages of Boeing wiring diagrams and found that one particular port—typically protected by only a hatch without a lock—connected to a certain 737 bus that carries the data for two crucial computer components on the plane, its Flight Management Computer and its Multipurpose Control Display Unit. Soon after, Crowe discovered, using the group's avionics test bed, that when he connected to that bus and sent electrical signals with a higher current than the legitimate ones used to send commands between those components of the 737, he could override those commands with his own, a technique that the researchers would later dub “Bus Driver.”

Now he had found an accessible foothold on the network from which he could send those electrical commands and tamper with the plane’s flight plan and critical parts of the pilot's interface. As Savage puts it, “it was like he had found the goddamn exhaust port on the Death Star.”

## **A Tiny Stowaway With In-Flight Wi-Fi**

In the spring of 2020, the team alerted Boeing to its findings and got a surprisingly interested response. They would continue to share updates with the company on their findings for years to come.

Crowe quickly refined their hacking device until he had a version of it that was small enough to fit into the exposed port on the 737 under a dust cap that typically covered it, entirely hiding the device from view. The tiny gadget included a chip capable of running their attack code as well as a Wi-Fi radio. That radio would, in theory, allow the hacking device to connect to the internet via the plane's in-flight Wi-Fi network and then beacon out to whoever controlled it, allowing the attacker to remotely control the device and the commands it sent.

When Covid hit, Schulman shipped the team’s avionics equipment to Crowe’s Bay Area home, and he continued working on it in his bedroom. Soon he had improved their device's ability to imperceptibly intercept, alter, and spoof commands to the plane's sensitive systems: It could, for instance, connect to the Flight Management Computer and alter the waypoints programmed into the plane's autopilot, redirecting the plane's flight, or alter variables like its weight or the outside temperature. By electronically tampering with the Multipurpose Control Display Unit, meanwhile, it could prevent those changes from showing up on the pilot's screen.

Trick the pilot into thinking the outside air was colder—or the plane's load of passengers and cargo was lighter—than in reality, and the 737 might not achieve the necessary speed for takeoff before running out of runway. Mess with the flight plan, and you could cause the autopilot to change the plane's heading to make it enter another country's airspace, where it could be commandeered by that country's air force. A sudden navigation change could potentially crash a plane into a mountain, or a slow one could send a transoceanic flight in the wrong direction until it ran out of fuel over water. “It could be something as subtle as, you're in the Pacific, you see blue everywhere, and this diverts you 3 degrees off course, and now you're in the middle of nowhere,” Schulman says.

The researchers note that a careful pilot would be able to recover from almost any of the attacks they've imagined: Taking manual control of the plane overrides its autopilot, and even if the Multipurpose Control Display Unit were hacked, the correct values would show up on a different screen in the cockpit. But even in this scenario, Schulman says, the pilot “would see that this is not lining up, but they would have no idea why, and it would be very confusing and probably lead them toward an uncertain conclusion about what to do next.” In a less optimistic scenario—or if the hacker implements a more subtle change—Schulman says a pilot might not notice until it was too late.

In their paper, the researchers outline a range of fixes for the vulnerability they've uncovered, starting with removing the connector in the vulnerable port altogether, or plugging it with epoxy. More long-term, though, they suggest planes' systems could be updated to include defenses in their software that detect their Bus Driver hacking technique, or that better electrically isolate systems, as in some military aircraft, or even add cryptographic authentication to prevent spoofing of signals among the plane's systems.

Calling for these kinds of updates—not just for Boeing, but across the aviation industry—is far from alarmist given the practicality of the attack the researchers describe, says Beau Woods, a cybersecurity consultant who has served as an adviser to the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency and as a member of Boeing's Industry Cyber Technical Council. “It is entirely possible to have someone who is on staff go up to an airplane when it's on the ground, going through maintenance, and put this type of thing in there,” says Woods, who read the researchers' work ahead of publication. The paper, he says, “looks like solid empirical evidence about some realistic scenarios for high-capability adversaries.”

The researchers' technique, he says, shows how the “threat model” for any highly sensitive system has to change as potential attackers' technology advances—in this case, as it became possible to fit an entire hardware setup capable of connecting to a plane's Wi-Fi and relaying commands to its systems onto a tiny disc hidden inside the dust cap of an obscure plug.

“Now that the research has been published, it can be understood and recognized that the reality has changed,” Woods says. “Threat models from the 20th century rarely survive contact with 21st-century tools and techniques.”
